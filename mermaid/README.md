# Mermaid rendering

This is a Docker based [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) renderer that uses the [Mermaid CLI](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli) project's [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/minlag/mermaid-cli) setup but configures and runs Mermaid directly. We could also just call the CLI but, well, this is an example.
